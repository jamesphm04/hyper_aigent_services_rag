This change will allow for more efficient querying that involves filtering based on metadata. Please note that filtering operators have been changed when using JSONB metadata to be prefixed with a $ sign to avoid name collisions with columns. If you're using an existing database, you will need to create a db migration for your metadata column to be JSONB and update your queries to use the new operators.

This change will allow for more efficient querying that involves filtering based on metadata. Please note that filtering operators have been changed when using JSONB metadata to be prefixed with a $ sign to avoid name collisions with columns. If you're using an existing database, you will need to create a db migration for your metadata column to be JSONB and update your queries to use the new operators.
